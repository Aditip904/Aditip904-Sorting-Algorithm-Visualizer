## Introduction
The **Sorting Algorithm Visualization** website is an interactive platform designed to help users understand how various sorting algorithms operate. By visualizing the process of sorting an array of numbers, users can gain a deeper insight into algorithm efficiency and behavior. The project includes several algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

### Project Goals
- Enhance understanding of sorting algorithms through visual representation.
- Provide a hands-on learning experience for students and programming enthusiasts.
- Allow users to experiment with different array sizes and sorting methods.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualization**: Step-by-step animation of sorting algorithms.
- **Customizable Array Size**: Users can specify the range of numbers to sort.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Visualize various sorting algorithms, including:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive design for easy navigation.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the layout and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the sorting algorithms and interactive features.
